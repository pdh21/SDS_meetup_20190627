## FACYNation
* Project with the University of Sussex and the Met. Office
* Develop model to predict how climate change affects crop yields
* Shirley et al. (submitted)

Note:
Demonstrate the benefit of this approach with an example based on a project
Forecasting Agricultural Crop Yields at National scales
* model climate-yield relationships 
* and provide accurate real-time yield forecasts and likely climate change impacts
* former collegue, we are co-authors

## The model
![](Slides/assets/model_inf.png?raw=true)<!-- .element height="85%" width="85%" -->

Note: 
High level overview:
* Takes in mean monthly temperature and total monthly precipitation
* learns what we call growth response function.: 
* how temperature and precipitation affect differential yield
* learn for each crop from archival data

## The model

Note: 
* use learnt model to predict yield from climate change predictions..work out best crop to grow in future
