### Data Science:
 * *Extracting information from Data*<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
 * *Using information to make predictions, decisions etc*<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


### Uncertainty is information
![](Slides/assets/uncertainty_example.png?raw=true)<!-- .element height="55%" width="55%" --><!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* You don't want to just know prediction<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* You want to know how certain you are about that prediction<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


### Probabilistic modelling
* Models that incorporate random variables and probability distributions<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Random variables represent the potential outcomes of an uncertain event<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Probability distributions assign probabilities to the potential outcomes<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->


* Realistic decision making necessitates recognising uncertainty<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* By incorporating uncertainty, we can measure the uncertainty associated with outputs<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Incorporating uncertainty leads to better decisions<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

Note:
* both in the inputs and outputs
* incorporating uncertainty in models, measure uncertainty in outputs such as predictions
* Incorporating uncertainty is synonymous with understanding and quantifying the risk in a business process, and ideally leads to better management decisions
* We can use Bayesian methods to infer parameters and make predictions from our probabilistic models
